# The original prjects was hosted on Heroku which is no longer free
I created a new PERN app with PostgreSQL as the data base and Neon and the database hoset and Render using Neon to get the data
Render does not have free PostgrSQL databases because they have to pay money for PostgreSQL to run the show (?)

I had a lot of CHAT GBT help, but could not have rewritten it with out it. 

## Available Scripts

In the project's client directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open http://localhost:3001 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\

### Deployment
## `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\

Will probably try to stay with Bulma for the Front End css Framework.
